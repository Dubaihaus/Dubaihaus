        "question": "How to Invest in Property?",

      },
      "q11": {
        "question": "How to Buy Off-Plan Property in Dubai?",

        "question": "Why Invest in Real Estate in Dubai?",
        "answer": "Property prices in Dubai are significantly lower than in many cities in Europe, America or Asia, while rental yields often remain attractive."
      },

      },
      "q15": {
        "question": "Can You Obtain Dubai Citizenship?",
